// Solution:


/**
 * mplement the following operations of a stack using queues.
 * push(x) -- Push element x onto stack.
 * pop() -- Removes the element on top of the stack.
 * top() -- Get the top element.
 * empty() -- Return whether the stack is empty.
 * Notes:
 * You must use only standard operations of a queue -- which means only push to back, peek/pop from front, size, 
 * and is empty operations are valid.
 * Depending on your language, queue may not be supported natively. 
 * You may simulate a queue by using a list or deque (double-ended queue), 
 * as long as you use only standard operations of a queue.
 * You may assume that all operations are valid (for example, no pop or top operations will be called on an empty stack).
