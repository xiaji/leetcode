/**
 * Given a binary search tree, write a function kthSmallest to find the kth smallest element in it.
 * Note:
 * You may assume k is always valid, 1 ≤ k ≤ BST's total elements.
 * Follow up:
 * What if the BST is modified (insert/delete operations) often and you need to find the kth smallest frequently?
 * How would you optimize the kthSmallest routine?
