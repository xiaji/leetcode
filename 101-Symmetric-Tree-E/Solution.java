/**
 * Given a binary tree, check whether it is a mirror of itself (ie, symmetric around its center).
 * For example, this binary tree [1,2,2,3,4,4,3] is symmetric:
      1
     / \
    2   2
  / \ / \
 3  4 4  3
 * But the following [1,2,2,null,3,null,3] is not:
    1
   / \
  2   2
   \   \
   3    3

 * Note:
 * Bonus points if you could solve it both recursively and iteratively. * */
